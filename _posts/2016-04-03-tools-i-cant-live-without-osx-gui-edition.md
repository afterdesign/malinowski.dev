So last time I wrote about my [favorite CLI tools](/2016/03/20/tools-i-cant-live-without-cli-edition.html)

This time I'm going to mention GUI tools I'm using all the time (if not daily).
And I have to mention here CLI tools were mostly general and could be used under any platform GUI tools below are mostly OS X based (some of them have win/linux options, like code editors).

As I wrote in last post I'm addicted to CLI (and IRC). This is the tool I'm using. I switched a while back from default OS X Terminal.app (I'm still not sure why, maybe because I can set properly meta key and shortcuts and maybe bacause of split panes ?)
